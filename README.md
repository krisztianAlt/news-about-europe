# news-about-europe

In this project I practice calling a REST API.

As a user you can select a country from the map of Europe. The program sends a request with your selected country and news agency to News API (https://newsapi.org/). News API sends datas of 20 articles in JSON format. The program sorts the articles by publishing date, then lists the article datas in a modal. If you want to, after you clicked a news, you can read the whole article in your browser.
